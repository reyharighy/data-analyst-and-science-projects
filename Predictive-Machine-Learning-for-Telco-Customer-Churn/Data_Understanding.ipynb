    "##### **Market Research**\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, telecommunications service subscribers have many choices and can easily switch subscriptions from one service provider to another. Not a few customers who frequently switch subscriptions because of the many promotions offered by various telecommunications service providers. Service providers who provide the best service and the most competitive prices will be the choice of customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Marketing practitioners in this industry try hard so that customers do not switch to become customers of competing companies. Why is that? Because acquiring new customers costs way more than retaining old and loyal customers. Thus, retaining existing customers is a higher priority than finding new customers. This refers to the journal *Reichheld, F.F. and Sasser, E. (1990) Zero Defects: Quality Comes to Services. Harvard Business Review, 68, 105-111*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Meanwhile, retaining customers is also not an easy matter. A common way is to provide offer packages with special prices or bonuses to customers so they are not tempted to switch to competing companies. As for this method, if it is given to all existing customers, it will be expensive because customers who have a tendency to churn (unsubscribe) are generally only a small number. There is no urgency to provide special offers or bonuses to loyal customers, because even without that they will still be customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "A better way is to ensure that special offers or bonuses are only given to certain customers who are known to have a tendency to churn. Because it is aimed specifically at certain customers, the costs required to provide promotions are lower.\n",
    "\n",
    "Churn Prediction is a predictive model that is widely used in the industry with the aim of finding and identifying which customers are most likely to unsubscribe, as well as knowing what symptoms or signs appear. By paying attention to these signs, subscribers who have a high probability of stopping can be contacted and then given a package offer at a special price to prevent them from completely unsubscribing."

    "##### **Case Analysis and Goals**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, a prediction model will be created for telecommunications companies that sell internet services. Not a few customers have switched to competing companies due to more attractive price and service offers, which has an impact on the company's loss of revenue and has the potential for customer dissatisfaction. The company's management is aware of this problem and plans to launch promotional programs to hold down the churn rate. This promotional program will only be offered to customer groups that are considered prone to churn. To be more effective, machine learning is needed to define this customer group.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this predictive model is to generate a churn score for each customer which indicates whether the customer in question is predicted to unsubscribe or not. This prediction model will use predictors in the form of customer patterns in using internet services on corporate networks. The results of this prediction will later be implemented into appropriate actions as described in the previous paragraph so that the number of churned customers will decrease, increase customer satisfaction, and be able to increase revenue and profitability for the company.\n",
    "\n",
    "How is it possible for the predictions made to look at customer usage patterns? A person's behavior in the past can be used as a benchmark to see the behavior in question in the future. These behaviors will be analyzed from the existing data. By knowing what signs indicate someone is about to unsubscribe, companies can do something to prevent them from actually unsubscribing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, the results of this model will be used by the company's marketing division to offer special packages to customers whose churn score is 'yes', with the aim of preventing them from switching to a competitor."
