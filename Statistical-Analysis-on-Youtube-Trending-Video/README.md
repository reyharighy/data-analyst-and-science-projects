## Problem Statements
In the context determined in background previously, it includes:
1. Do trending videos have the same quality and characteristics even though the video attributes vary?
2. Why can increased user accessibility help manage trending videos?
3. How can screening process help determine the suitability of uploaded content so that views and engagement increase?
4. What features can help improve the relationship between creators and content connoisseurs so that new content will be positively received?
5. How and how much is the relationship between various attributes in determining the sustainability of trending videos?

The hypothesis being tested is the anti-thesis of the problem background. Everything about the data has no significant intercorrelation and even if there is it is just coincidence.

## Analysis Method
Some of the statistical analysis techniques that will be used include statistical tests, factor analysis, and correlation analysis. In addition, data visualization techniques will also be used to facilitate understanding of patterns and trends within the dataset.

## Data Understanding
This dataset is provided as material for working on the topic of Trending Video Statistics on YouTube specifically for the United States region. In the early stages, the information contained will be described in more depth to understand its characteristics. As material for analysis, the datasets used are sourced from [following link](Datasets.zip). Find the detailed process in [Data Understanding](Data_Understanding.ipynb).

## Data Preparation
This section will focus on the process of transforming raw data into ready-to-use data. All of these processes will be examined in each column and, if necessary, delete unnecessary columns or, conversely, add new columns to enrich the insights needed in the Explanaroty Data Analysis section. Find the detailed process in [Data Preparation](Data_Preparation.ipynb).

## Explanatory Data Analysis
In this section, data will be examined, transformed, and also modeled to identify patterns, trends, and information useful in making decisions. This includes recommendations based on insights found. Find the detailed analysis in [Explanatory Data Analysis](Explanatory_Data_Analysis.ipynb).
